# Project Log
As you may know, a resume is only so big and a developer's work never truly ends. Because of this, I've made a running log of all my projects. My resume will have the highlights of my work, but this github repository will hold *all* of my projects. I won't put the actual code here, but I'll have little descriptions and such, maybe screenshots. And I'll probably put a link to each github repo for each entry too.

- Currently all of my projects are in development or were finished before I discovered github, but here's the stuff I'm working on now:
  - C calculator that takes numbers from of a given base
  - JavaScript MEAN Stack Twitter Mock
  - My church's website ([current version](http://deeperlifefdcc.org/))
